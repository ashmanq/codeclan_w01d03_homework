# Ruby Array and Hashes Quiz
This app contains three scripts that I created to demonstrate my knowledge of how to manipulate 
arrays and hashes in the Ruby programming language.

# Run App
To run the app use the following command in terminal:
```Ruby
ruby exercise_a_stops.rb
ruby exercise_b_users.rb
ruby exercise_c_uk.rb
```
